# Hotel Search Using CakePHP

## Installation

1. Clone the directory in your PHP Directory.
2. Execute URL in browser with `http://localhost/hotel-search/`.

Here I am fetching json data with CURL. And manage in Array form.

I have used php filter for the search result from the JSON.

You can find out main logic in `/src/Controller/HotelsController.php`

And Design part in, `/src/Template/Hotels/index.ctp`.
